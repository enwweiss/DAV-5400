I turned on the marine weather on the skiff\\'s radio and learned that we were in a tropical disturbance and that a hurricane plane had been sent out to view the center of it. George Anderson and Jimbo Meador were my companions, two men who never confuse angling with male bonding: fine dining and gentlemanly hours were out the window. We had fueled up at the dock instead of siphoning gas from the rental car with a borrowed garden hose, as George and I had done in the past. We were going to look for tarpon in a new place, a stretch of south Florida beach, a deep pass, broad, sandy banks that looked ready to receive spring migrants. We had a watermelon in the ice box, sandwiches, a couple of gallons of water. With George aboard, this would be all there was to eat until the last drop of gas had been burned looking for fish. George had tied up a supply of leaders, cautioning us to lubricate our knots with Chap Stick instead of spit. \"Use spit and you overheat these co-polymers. You break off a lot of fish.\" George had been chasing tarpon so long this spring in the Keys that he had tendinitis from pulling up leader knots. Jimbo had never caught a tarpon before and right now it was the only thing in the world he cared about. I had made a blind guess that this area would hold fish, but I wasn\\'t really sure.',\n",

The scientists say there is no evidence that the virus can infect people. The virus, bovine immunodeficiency-like virus, or BIV, is spread through the blood and is a member of a family of slow-acting viruses that have been shown to reduce the activity of an animal's immune system. Such immune suppression, veterinarians said today, can open the way for other infections. The virus, which was first isolated in 1969, has been shown to cause illness in calves, a top scientist at the Department of Agriculture said today. Scientists say they believe that the virus causes immune suppression in adult cattle, but how powerful it is remains uncertain.\",\n",

The cuts include a 5 percent salary reduction for the company president, Jerry K. Myers, and a requirement that each department cut its expenses by 15 percent, Mr. Jeff said. The cuts come after a 60-day voluntary leave of absence taken by 298 employees, which began in April and will end June 10.

Many lenders prefer a variable rate for mortgages, home equity loans, personal loans and charge cards. Usually the variable rate is tied to some index like the prime rate. Still, variable-rate loans are not always best. For example, if the choice is between an 11 percent variable-rate personal loan and one at a 12 percent fixed rate, the weekly Bank Rate Monitor says the fixed-rate loan is the better deal because it is only a point higher and it won't go up in the future. Here is a glossary of variable-rate loan terms, and some advice. Margin: The percentage points the lending institution adds to an index. Make comparisons among the lenders. Index: Understand how the index moves and when yours could change. Stick to loans with publicly known indexes, like the prime rate or Treasury bills. Avoid banks that set the rate at their discretion. Rate Changes: Ask how often the rate can change and when changes are effective. Some banks will time cuts in their prime rate so as to force borrowers to pay the higher rate a month longer.\",\n",

The game matched two of the nation's top offensive teams. Creighton led the county with a .361 batting average and Clemson was tops in team scoring a 10-run average. Creighton (50-20) rewarded the fourth-largest crowd in C.W.S. history with 11 hits off six Clemson pitchers and the 16,244 in attendance made plenty of noise for their hometown team in its first national championships. Creighton pitcher Mike Heathcott scattered seven hits and earned a school record 15th victory against one loss. The Bluejays advanced to Monday night's winners bracket game against the winner of the Wichita State-Long Beach State game last night. Clemson (60-9) dropped to an elimination game Monday afternoon against the Wichita-Long Beach loser. (AP) Jacksonville State Wins Division II Title: Mark Adams drove in five runs in an 11-run sixth inning as Jacksonville State coasted to its second straight N.C.A.A. Division II championship, routing Missouri Southern, 20-4, in Montgomery, Ala. (AP) GOLF Walker Leads Bradley by Two Strokes Colleen Walker got off to a slow start but birdied the 16th and 17th holes to take a two-shot lead over Beth Daniel after three rounds of the Ladies Professionl Golfers Association Rochester International. Walker, who has not won a tournament this year, was one over after nine holes, but collected four birdies on the back for a three-under-par 69. She is at 10-under-par 206 after three rounds on the 6,162-yard Locust Hill Country Club course. Daniel shot a 71 and was followed by Pat Bradley, a two-time winner of the Rochester tournament, and Trish Johnson of Wales, both at 209. Michelle Estill, who started the day leading at eight-under-par, had one birdie and seven bogeys to fall to two under. (AP) Ballesteros Leads by Seven in England: Seve Ballesteros of Spain stretched his lead in the British Masters to seven strokes by shooting a four-under-par 68 in the third round yesterday at Woburn, England. The nearest challenger to Ballesteros, who has a 54-hole total of 200, is Eamon Darcy of Ireland, who eagled the final hole for a 71. Two strokes behind Darcy him are Tony Charnley, Keith Waters and David Gilford of England and Sam Torrance of Scotland. Gilford shot the best round of the day, a 65, while Charnley fired 66 and Torrance 71. Waters struggled to a 73. Mark Calcavecchia, four strokes back when the third round began, had two bogeys to go with his four birdies over the first 12 holes and then had a double-bogey at the 13th. He bogeyed the next hole, too, and dropped further back with another at the 17th to slip to five under par. In five holes, Calcavecchi had dropped as many strokes and finished with a 74 for a share of seventh place. (AP) CYCLING Soviet Wins Sixth Stage in Tour of Italy Vladimir Pulnikov of the Soviet Union sprinted ahead in the last seconds to win the sixth stage of the Tour of Italy cycling race yesterday in Rieti. Franco Chioccioli of Italy kept his overall lead. Pulnikov finished the mountainous stage in 5 hours 19 minutes 47 seconds. He moved up to third in the overall standing, 51 seconds behind Marino Lejarreta of Spain. Greg LeMond of the United States finished 41st, dropping 2:32 further back in the standing. He is now nearly four minutes behind Chioccioli.

Ms. Petro mentioned that traveling by car -- the means she chose -- is not the best way for Americans to see Iceland. I would suggest using buses and planes. A bus pass is available for about $200 and permits unlimited travel for a week. The Icelandair Iceland Air Pass costs $190 and is valid for 30 days. It offers four flights within the country. An Air-Bus Rover ticket for a single trip (flying from Reykjavik to Akureyri and returning by bus) is available for $121. Longer combination trips are also offered. These plans allow an individual to get to a particularly interesting area inexpensively. Then the traveler can take a local sightseeing tour or rent a car in the region.',\n",

These fans are eager to learn what Gehrig's true relationship was with his Yankee brother-in-arms, Babe Ruth. For after all, these two sluggers formed the marrow of the Yankees' omnipotent ball club from 1925, when Gehrig became a regular, through 1934, when Ruth's Yankee career ended, as complementary as ham and eggs.\",\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'For the National Party of South Africa\\'s President, F. W. de Klerk, its decision last year to open its ranks to all races is reaping an almost embarrassing political dividend. In the last week and a half, 32 of the 85 members of the House of Representatives, a Parliament chamber designated for South Africans of mixed race, have left their old parties and joined the Nationalists, now that the governing party has set out to dismantle the apartheid system. In South Africa, there is a white chamber of Parliament and two smaller chambers, one for mixed-race legislators and another for ethnic Indians. Blacks, the majority in this country, have no representatives there. The change-over by the mixed-race legislators to the National Party, which devised apartheid, bolsters the nonracial image Mr. de Klerk is cultivating. The National Party has promised the 33 new members equal participation with its 103 whites. \"I have no doubt that these historical events are merely the beginning of a process,\" Mr. de Klerk said last week. \"In fact, more admissions to membership of the National Party may be expected in the coming weeks.\" But that has antagonized the Rev. Allan Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race Labor Party, which has long dominated the House of Representatives. He said he felt \"betrayed and double-crossed\" by the National Party, which he accused of raiding his ranks. Some Leverage Remains Before Parliament adjourns in three weeks, Mr. Hendrickse could retaliate by challenging Mr. de Klerk\\'s promised repeal of the last major apartheid laws on the ground that the changes do not go far enough. So many Labor Party politicians have crossed over that the National Party has found itself the official opposition in the House of Representatives and may end up controlling the chamber within days, as it has done for 41 years in the white House of Assembly. Some legislators in the House of Delegates, the Indian chamber, are now curious about joining the National Party, too. Such alliances were unforeseen when the current Constitution was adopted eight years ago. To the existing white chamber of Parliament, it added the two smaller chambers. This change was structured so that the mixed-race and Indian lawmakers would be outnumbered by whites, though the new chambers were given veto rights over legislation in some circumstances. Mr. de Klerk says the black majority will be enfranchised in a new constitution awaiting negotiation. \"For students of the constitutionally bizarre, it\\'s a collector\\'s item,\" David Welsh, a political scientist at the University of Cape Town, said of the nation\\'s legislative system. Scant Voter Enthusiasm Most South Africans of mixed race and Indian descent dismiss their chambers as devices for perpetuating apartheid. Barely one in five eligible nonwhite voters bothered to cast ballots in the last elections in September 1989. Not one of the mixed-race legislators who crossed over to the National Party has expressed misgivings about its history as the architect of legalized racial discrimination. \"We must try to forget the past of the National Party,\" said Patrick McKenzie, a Labor Party legislator who, after denouncing earlier defectors, became the latest to join Mr. de Klerk\\'s ranks. \"If people do not forget and forgive the past, we will never be able to build a new South Africa,\" Mr. McKenzie said. For President de Klerk, whose strategy increasingly appears one of seeking alliances across racial lines, the defections have opened a door to South Africans of mixed race, who number three million of nearly 38 million people. \"I have no doubt,\" the President said, \"that the National Party will eventually become the political home of all moderate South Africans who wish to insure that the new South Africa will be a true democracy offering peace and prosperity to all its people and to every minority.\"',\n",

More often, they take violent exception, calling into question not just the qualities of the singers described but the mental, musical and moral essence of the describer. Only rock-and-roll fans exhibit a comparable degree of blind (selectively deaf?) intensity, but opera buffs boast bigger vocabularies and write longer letters. Two recent experiences reminded me of this volatile blend of subjectivity and passion. One was listening to learned musicologists, critics and performers disagree about the basic attributes of voices they had just heard via recordings at the concurrent Lincoln Center Mozart symposium and annual meeting of the Music Critics Association. The other was a column I wrote a couple of weeks ago about Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo and their forays into heavier repertory, respectively Otello and Parsifal.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'IT is close to midnight along the Hudson in Battery Park City. Airplanes are circling like fireflies. Couples, the sort who have all supposedly fled New York, are swinging their attache cases, holding hands and debating at what point a yacht becomes vulgar. Teen-agers are searching their souls, as they do when they get near a body of water at that age. Skaters are out for one last roll. No one is looking over his shoulder. New York City, that old hypochondriac, may be dying again, but the angels are not descending quite yet. Here, night or day, the salt in the air induces a euphoria that makes a New Yorker want to toast the future. There are enough bars in and near Battery Park City to keep a pub crawler going from noon to midnight. Each comes into its own at a different hour. Each offers a different perspective on the Hudson River and New York Harbor. And each quickly reminds the reluctant New Yorker that he or she, like New York, will more than likely still be here next year. Edward Moran Bar And Grill 4 World Financial Center, Street Level, 250 Vesey Street, (212) 945-2255. Edward Moran Bar and Grill comes to a rolling boil at 6 or 7 P.M. on Friday. No directions are needed. Follow the roar. At this hour, Moran\\'s, where families eat hamburgers on Sunday afternoons, turns into Fort Lauderdale at spring break. The baby bankers of Wall Street are here for one last rally. Coy hair flips, and posing -- the process known as the perpetuation of the species -- will keep the place going until long after dark. \"I\\'m supposed to meet a guy who\\'s medium height, dark hair, in his 20\\'s,\" a panicked woman with very pink nails and a drink to match was heard telling a security guard. \"He\\'s probably here.\" He probably is. Peter Higgins, the owner and manager of the restaurant, says several thousand people show up on a typical Friday, a majority of them medium-height, dark-haired men in their 20\\'s, in limp button-down shirts with collars unfastened. For the sake of mood, the security guards wear polo shirts, and the bartenders act as if they have worked as traders on the commodities exchange. \"Come on! Talk to me!\" One has to be fast to close a deal here. The bulls order beer, and lots of it. The bears seem partial to something red called a Cape Codder. As evening deepens, the crowd becomes louder. The sun sets on Moran\\'s in the most flattering way, throwing golden light on everybody until, speech slurred and steps unsure, they weave their way under the palm trees in the Winter Garden and catch subway trains back to their studio apartments. The Hors d\\'Oeuvrerie 1 World Trade Center, 107th Floor, (212) 938-1100. Many New Yorkers are disinclined to visit the Hors d\\'Oeuvrerie, the 107th-floor bar adjoining Windows on the World, for fear of mingling with tourists. They should get over it. \"The elevator will be here in four minutes,\" announced the maitre d\\'hotel in the lobby. Pass the oxygen masks. The Hors d\\'Oeuvrerie and Windows on the World are decorated in a style that had its moment at the 1964-65 New York World\\'s Fair. It has now come full circle from high Futurism to even higher camp. The only really suitable attire here (no sneakers, jeans or shorts allowed) would be early Cardin or Courreges. Because every bar needs a few asteroids, there is a hall of mirrors lined with huge mineral specimens. There are also amoeboid leather-lined niches, molded chairs that defy gravity, and a palette out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Eventually one stops gaping at the decor and actually looks out the window, with amazement. The Hors d\\'Oeuvrerie has a view to the south and east, with that unique Dr. Caligari perspective. The waiters collect a $3.50 cover charge and let patrons have even one long, slow drink in peace. For that, one also gets the Judd Woldin Trio -- its motto is \"Dance, glance and listen\" -- playing standards beneath a mural of an Italian Line ship that hasn\\'t visited New York in decades. Pipeline 2 World Financial Center, Street Level, 225 Liberty Street, (212) 945-2755. The staff members at Pipeline, students of the downtown scowl and the occasional shave, perpetually seem to be getting over a long, hard night. Don\\'t get in their way. But for a deconstructed beer, this is the place to go, preferably in spandex and on roller blades. The designer Sam Lopata\\'s decor for this bar and restaurant is Early Refinery: pipes, more pipes and lots of safety yellow paint. The music is loud, and the concrete and metal surfaces make it louder. The terrace is much quieter, with a view of the Hudson, the sunset and the yachts that lounge in the North Cove marina. Do not be put off by the uncomfortable-looking metal chairs. They may be the most comfortable chairs in any restaurant in the neighborhood. Do expect to be asked frequently to order the next round. And do visit the restroom, which is unisex. Men and women share the chiquest slop sinks in Manhattan. The Hudson River Club 4 World Financial Center, Bridge Level, 250 Vesey Street, (212) 786-1500. At most restaurants, the bar is at the front, a catchall for diners awaiting tables. At the Hudson River Club, it is at the back, a catchall for people lucky enough to know it is there. It is there, all snug and woody and green, all sailing prints and ship models, and one could easily convince oneself that this is Newport Beach, Calif. There is a second-floor view across the yachts in North Cove -- Impetuous, Precious Moments, catamarans that look like huge mosquitoes -- all the way downriver to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Fresh potato chips from the kitchen and other snacks were provided by the bartender, who let patrons linger over a single glass. A pianist kept the mood fizzy. The perpetual candlelight here is a pleasant way to extend a late-night stroll on the Esplanade. Do not, however, arrive dressed too casually; jeans, even worn with an Armani jacket, do not please this maitre d\\'hotel. Le Pactole 2 World Financial Center, Bridge Level, 225 Liberty Street, (212) 945-9444. So much for the America\\'s Cup crowd. At Le Pactole, the waiters wear black tie, and the windows seem to wear Oscar de la Renta. Le Pactole is grand, so grand that one may feel silly unless what one has to say lives up to the setting. The bar is oval, with superb people-viewing possibilities; the huge windows overlooking the Hudson are lined with deep, slouchy tub chairs that Josef Hoffman might have designed, and the windows wear evening dresses made of gauzy white fabric. But those draperies, usually lowered against the western sun and the glare off the river, do cast an attractive glow over everyone and everything. Indeed, the best time at Le Pactole is sunset, when an orange fireball drops behind the Colgate clock in Jersey City, making it the most romantic tube of toothpaste in the world. Steamers Landing On the Esplanade, between Liberty and Albany Streets, (212) 432-1451. Late on weekend afternoons, a procession of cruise ships glides down the Hudson. One cannot get much closer than Steamers Landing: two small sheltered patios attached to a bar and restaurant, the only one on the Esplanade proper. Here one can raise a glass of Champagne to all those bound for Bermuda. One can also watch the crowd go by without being part of it. On a recent Saturday afternoon, couples were here poring over floor plans for condominiums in Battery Park City. One supposes they were engaged in that rite of spring: wondering where the breakfront might go if they exchanged that Tudor in Bergen County for a crackerbox on the Hudson. Time a visit to Steamers to coincide with a sailing of the Queen Elizabeth 2, especially one at night. Even the most jaded New Yorkers hurry to the Esplanade railing to watch nearly 1,000 feet of ship glide downriver in the long, long wake of the Mauretania, the Normandie and the Queen Mary. Amazon Village Pier 25, West Side Highway at North Moore Street; (212) 227-2900. The palm trees swaying on Pier 25 -- a 10-minute walk north of Battery Park City, just south of the prison barge -- belong to a new bar and restaurant called Amazon Village. They will sway there only until Oct. 15, when they will be dug up, potted and sent to hotel lobbies for the winter. Club Med, meet Hawaii Kai. Amazon Village includes a bar called Python, a volleyball court, a beach, a lifeguard, a cage filled with parrots and valet parking. \"We didn\\'t need so much sand,\" said a modest Shimon Bokovza, the restaurateur who opened the club last weekend with his brother, Koby, and Michael Buchsbaum. Shimon Bokovza has experience with sand. He has another Amazon Village in Philadelphia, which is closed this summer while he nearly doubles its size. This Amazon Village, which he called much more \"conceptually developed,\" is a tribute to the rain forest, which he called \"the last frontier, the last place left as God created it.\" So there is a Rain Forest Bar. There is a rain forest mural. Pennies pitched into the fountain are to be donated to the Rainforest Alliance. Mr. Bokovza has never been to Brazil. That concept is still being developed.',\n",

The sovereign\\'s real personal wealth is no more than what she would be permitted to retain as her own property if the Monarchy were replaced. The figure of $10 billion is mostly composed of inalienable fixed assets and works of art, of which the sovereign is merely the temporary custodian and which can never be sold. The high valuation of the landed estates has fallen victim to a collapsing real-estate market. The value of the royal art and stamp collection is based on very approximate assessments of groups of individual works. The cumulative value of the art, as estimated, is already more than five times that of the world art market in those areas and, since it could not possibly be absorbed at such prices, it must be considerably discounted.',\n",

But a nice working definition comes from the novelist Anne Lamott, who, in a recent Mademoiselle article, dubbed the stuff \"Brooklyns,\" which is certainly a cozier rubric than \"cellulite\" and perhaps more site-specific. \"It stems from the geographic shape of those triangular pooches of fat that are just kind of glued onto your butt the way Brooklyn is glued onto Manhattan,\" she explains. \"Gack!\"',\n",

And the auction last month by Sotheby's in New York of three ceremonial masks -- two Hopi and one probably Navajo -- sparked protests by Indians. The protest did not stop the seller and Sotheby's from proceeding with the sale on May 14. However, it spurred Elizabeth Sackler, president of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation in New York, to buy the masks for $39,050. She said later she would return the masks to the Indians.\",\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'The recession seems to be ending. But the overwhelming consensus is that the recovery will not amount to much. There is talk of a \"double dip\" downturn, and few expect strong growth. The stock market, however, seems to have a different opinion, That contrary notion, of coming strength in the economy, is conveyed not just by the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average last week rose 113.59 points, to 3,027.50, setting a record and closing above 3,000 for the first time since April 17. It may also be significant that it is no longer the recession-resistant consumer stocks, like Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris, that are leading the charge. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, four are now at least 10 percent higher than they were when the average first closed over 3,000. All are big, grimy, cyclical stocks: Du Pont, Goodyear, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. International Paper and Union Carbide have risen almost as much. If those moves are to make sense, then this economy needs than a weak recovery. The bond market\\'s refusal to rally may also be sending a signal of surprising economic strength,. The Federal Reserve has pushed short-term interest rates dopwn sharply, and American investors have taken the hint. Sales of mutural funds are booming. And yet, as Fred Leiner, an economist at Continental Bank, points out, long-term interest rates have been stalled for six months, making minor moves but essentially going sideways. \"I\\'m concerned by some similarities with late 1986,\" he said. \"We see money pouring into bond funds, yet the bond market is unable to move higher. Those similarities suggest the market may move lower from these levels.\" In late 1986 and early 1987, he recalled, the bond market stalled while stocks leaped. Then bond prices crashed in the spring, and stock prices followed the fall. This year, there are certainly plenty of reasons to doubt that the economy can rebound strongly. The debt overhang that helped to bring on this recession has not disappeared, and the Government\\'s efforts to fight the recession have been limited by the severe fiscal problems brought on by the profligacy of the 1980\\'s. It is hard to imagine a new boom in commercial construction. Moreover, the evidence that the recession is ending, while persuasive to a lot of stock traders, is still limited,. The leading indicators have risen for three consecutive months, and factory orders turned up in April. Consumers tell pollsters the present is bad, but the future will be better, and they seem to translate those beliefs into cautious spending, not a panicky increase in savings. Stock market analysts note that secondary stocks, which were leaders in the winter rally, are lagging as summer begins, Their particiaption would make this rally a more impressive one. But for all that, it is a fact that the economy usually finds a way to surprise the seers. A strong recovery this year would certianly qualify as a surprise. Perhaps, just perhaps, that is the current message of the markets.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'Dingy Public Areas Question: I live in a 20-unit, rent-stabilized apartment house. The condition of the hallways and lobby is horrendous. To my knowledge these areas have not been painted in 12 years. Is there a rule that requires owners to maintain the public areas as well as the apartments? . . . Roberta Lipman, Manhattan Answer: Yes. The housing maintenance code, Article 2 d, Sec. 26-12.01, a (2), requires that public areas be maintained. Maintenance, the code says, includes repair and repainting when necessary. But since the code does not set a specfic timetable, it would be up to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which administers the code, to determine if the public areas in a particular building are due for a paint job. Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said that an owner could face rent reductions if an order from H.P.D. to paint and repair public areas was ignored. For an inspection, call the H.P.D. Central Complaint Bureau at 960-4800. A Problem With Pests Question: I moved into a rent-regulated apartment recently and since then I have had a problem with roaches and mice. I had neither in my old apartment, where an exterminator came in once a month. Is a landlord legally required to have the building exterminated on a regular basis? . . . Terry O\\'Niell, Manhattan. Answer: No. But the housing maintenance code does require that owners keep their property free of infestation of rodents, insects or other pests. \"If the only way that pests like roaches can be controlled,\" said Roz Abrams, a spokesman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, \"is through some kind of scheduled extermination, then the landlord would have to arrange for it.\" If notifying the owner or his representative of the roach and mouse problem produces no results, you can contact H.P.D. The department will send an inspector to your building. If evidence of infestation is found the owner will be issued a violation. To remove the complaint, the owner would have to show that the infestation had been cured. Call 960-4800 for an inspection. Damage Claim in a Co-op Question: My co-op, which I use as a pied-a-terre, was flooded because of faulty plumbing. The ceiling, walls and some of the furniture suffered water or mildew damage. For weeks at a time my wife and I could not use the apartment. After more than a year the management company completed the repairs to the apartment, but it never turned my claim for the damage to clothing and furnishings over to the building\\'s insurance company. I withheld maintenance payments of about $3,000 for the cost to us of extra cleaning services, to pay for the replacement of corroded wiring and telephone lines and for reimbursement of time I needed to spend in New York but had to book a hotel room. I feel my claim is reasonable, but my lawyer and the managing company tell me that what I have done is not acceptable. Do I have a case? . . . John D. Rich, Stamford, Conn. Answer: Probably not. According to John Calagna, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Insurance, insurance policies carried by co-op corporations cover losses pertaining to their structures but do not normally cover the personal belongings of the shareholders. Reimbursement claims for the damage to your furniture and clothing should have been made to your homeowners policy insurer.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'A cancer-causing chemical has been found in the milk of a nursing mother who has breast implants covered with polyurethane foam, a scientist said yesterday. The amount of the carcinogen, toluene diamene or TDA, found in the woman was extremely small and was not likely to pose a health threat to her infant, said the scientist, Dr. David Black of Vanderbilt University, who was hired by the manufacturer of the implant to look for traces of TDA in the body. Although traces of TDA have been found in only one case of breast milk, Dr. Black said he believed it was likely that other women with implants might also have the chemical in their milk. But he emphasized that any hazard to infants from TDA was minor, saying nursing mothers exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke passed on a greater amount of carcinogens to their breast-fed babies. Issue for Women The real issue for women, he said, may be the emotional stress that comes from knowing a potentially harmful chemcial may be passing from them to their baby. \"TDA contaminates a natural process,\" he said. The manufacturer, the Surgitek Corporation, a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb, immediately disputed Dr. Black\\'s findings, saying that his method of analyzing the milk created the TDA artificially and that the implants posed no hazard to nursing mothers or their babies. \"We disagree with his testing procedure,\" said Jonathan Weisberg, a company spokesman. \"We have submitted data about this to the F.D.A. and we remain confident in the safety of polyurethane foam covered breast implants.\" Dr. Black, a toxicologist who is also president of the Aegis Analytical Corporation, a drug testing company in Nashville, Tenn., said Bristol-Myers had no evidence to support its criticism of his methods. The chemical has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals, but eating it is not thought to pose as much of a risk as having it implanted directly into the body, Dr. Black said. Dr. Elizabeth Jacobson, deputy director of the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the agency would look very carefully at the new finding. \"TDA should not be there,\" she said. \"If Dr. Black is right, it\\'s just one more indication that the foam really does break down into TDA.\" About 200,000 of the two million American women who have had breast implants have implants covered with the polyurethane foam. It is not known how many of them have breast-fed their babies but many are of childbearing age. Surgitek voluntarily withdrew its products, known as the Meme, Optimene and Replicon implants, from the market in April after questions about TDA were raised in the news media. As part of its effort to submit safety data to the F.D.A. Surgitek hired Dr. Black in 1988 to develop a method to look for TDA in urine and milk. The finding about breast milk began to circulate among critics of polyurethane foam implants late last week. \"The word was out,\" said Sibyl Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, a group devoted to the problems of implant patients. \"We kept waiting for the F.D.A. to announce something, but they never did.\" Reached by telephone and asked to confirm the finding, Dr. Black agreed to describe the experiment. It is important to be \"truthful and honest\", he said. The F.D.A. and Surgitek have known about TDA in breast milk for several weeks, he said, and \"women with implants deserve to know.\" Because most of his research on implants has been carried out under contract to Surgitek, Dr. Black said he could not comment fully on his results. He did say he has tested the urine of \"a small population\" of women immediately before and after implant surgery to look for TDA. \"We have seen some short term presence of TDA in urine which we felt was from residues\" on the foam, Dr. Black said, and not from the foam breaking up in the body. . The breast milk sample was not analyzed as part of his contracts with Surgitek, Dr. Black said. The work was requested by a local plastic surgeon who wanted to assure his patient that it was safe to nurse her baby with foam implants inside her body, Dr. Black said. The woman has had her implants for two years and apparently has not had any problems with them, he said. The test revealed that the woman\\'s milk had three to four parts of TDA per billion, Dr. Black said. The test also found traces of of TDA in her urine. Dr. Black said that he was very surprised to find the TDA in milk. But, he said, it is logical given that the implant is in the same place where milk is produced. The finding \"would suggest that the foam is degrading,\" he said. Dr. Black\\'s colleague at his drug testing company, Mark Faulkner said, \"when we got the results off the machine, my spine chilled.\" The test was done to reassure the mother, he said, but it did not work out that way. The finding needs to be verified in other women, Dr. Black said. But the fact that TDA turned up in the first lactating woman tested, he said, suggests the problem might be common. Canadian doctors recently reported that they found TDA in the urine of a woman who had had Meme implants for seven months and published their results in a scientific journal.',\n",

Cut each breast into quarters and saute in hot oil in a nonstick pan. 2. If using whole onions, slice them thinly. When the chicken is browned on one side, turn it and brown on the second side and add onions. 3. When onions have begun to soften and brown, add tomato puree and Worcestershire sauce. Season with pepper, cover and reduce heat to simmer. Cook until chicken is tender, about 10 minutes. 4. Stir in cilantro before serving. Yield: 2 servings. Couscous With Peas and Corn 3/4 cup couscous 1 cup frozen corn kernels 1 cup frozen peas 1 teaspoon cumin 2 scallions 1/8 teaspoon salt, optional. 1. Following package directions, bring water to boil to cook couscous. 2. Run the corn and peas under hot water in a strainer and drain. 3. When water boils, stir in couscous, corn, peas and cumin. Cover, turn off the heat, and allow liquid to absorb, 3 to 5 minutes. 4. Wash, trim and chop scallions, and stir into couscous when it is cooked. Season with salt, if desired.

The Furness Library, finished in 1891 as the main library of the University of Pennsylvania and now brilliantly restored in honor of its centennial, is enough to put to rest forever any talk of Victorian primness; this is one of the most sensuous buildings I have ever encountered. It is architecture to wallow in, architecture that is capable of sending the emotions to a fever pitch, even as it fully satisfies the intellect. This remarkable structure is one of the few remaining works by Philadelphia's great master of Victorian Gothic Mannerism, Frank Furness. Furness's architecture was intensely powerful, and sometimes almost deliberately perverse, full of unexpected juxtapositions of the gentle and the tough, the big and the small, the refined and the raw. These elements come together as a complex, energetic whole, and it is no exaggeration to speak of Furness's buildings as embracing the whole scope of 19th-century American culture. It seems right and natural that Furness's father's close friends were Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman: honesty and passion are the themes of his architecture, as much as space and light.\",\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'Organizers and producers who bring foreign artists to the United States for performances have learned to their dismay that an immigration measure passed by Congress without debate last fall could sharply restrict their activities. But the Administration and Congress are expected to act shortly to ease their concerns. One of the major concerns about the new law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1, is the cap of 25,000 that it will place on the number of foreign performers who may receive visas to enter the United States each year. It cannot be calculated if that number is greater or smaller than the number of visas allowed under present law. The reason, said Richard L. Kenney, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is that performers have been part of a larger category - with a maximum of 78,000 visas - that included \"doctors, lawyers, skilled craftsmen, journalists; anybody recognized in a field or as a professional.\" No records have been kept to show how many were in the arts. A key Senate aide involved with the new bill agreed with Mr. Kenney\\'s assessment. Jerry M. Tinker, principal subcommittee staff officer to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, said th bill would be changed. \"The artificial cap of 25,000 came out of the blue,\" Mr. Tinker said. Since the 25,000 figure is in the statute, he added, changing it would require a Congressional bill known as a technical correction. Another section of the new law that would be changed by administrative process or in the technical correction, he said, is a prohibition against applying for a visa more tha 90 days before the scheduled trip. Presenters of operas and ballets have complained that such performances have to scheduled years in advance and that the performers need to apply early so they can be sure they will be admitted. Lobbying for Change Representatives of arts organizations remain concerned. One group, the League of American Theaters and Producers, is lobbying to change some of the provisions, particularly the 90-day limit on applying for visas. George Wachtel, the league\\'s research director, said, \"They went about this without consulting the industry affected.\" That charge was disputed by Bruce A. Morrison, a former Representative from Connecticut who, as chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law, led the House\\'s work in drafting the new law. \"This provision was drafted after extensive consultation with workers as well as owners,\" he said. \"The legitimate interest of U.S. workers were protected without denying entry to a full range of foreign artists.\" Mr. Morrison said the number of performers who could be admitted under the new law was almost certainly larger than before. Recognized or Unique Mr. Kenney of the immigration service said the rules establish the criteria under which up to 25,000 visas may be issued each year to entertainers and athletes. Applicants will have to demonstrate that they are \"internationally recognized,\" performing under a reciprocal arrangement, or participating in a culturally unique area. Performers who do not meet those criteria will be able to apply in a separate category for people of \"extraordinary ability.\" Mr. Morrison said he thought most performers would be admitted under one category or another. Mr. Tinker said the measure was approved in the rush to adjourn Congress last October and that Senate negotiators would not have agreed to the changes had they known of the difficulties the measure would cause. \"We were led to believe it was housecleaning,\" Mr. Tinker said. \"There\\'s a broad consensus on what ought to be done.\"',\n",

The two-year-old service sends no less than 800 on-line features to 550,000 subscribers for a flat monthly fee of $12.95. Since going national last fall, it has doubled its membership, to nearly one million. Membership represents the number of passwords issued to each subscriber, with up to six available at no additional cost. Prodigy uses membership numbers to set the rates it charges advertisers to run commercials on its service. It now accounts for 41.4 percent of the industry total, compared with 33.1 percent for the next-biggest company, H & R Block\\'s Compuserve Inc., and 10.8 percent for General Electric Information Services\\' Genie.',\n",

Well, for starters, consider the fact that the nominees, who will be honored on CBS starting at 9 P.M., do not represent the best of the 1990-91 season -- they represent all of the 1990-91 season. Nearly every production seen on Broadway since this time last year has been nominated for something. The question raised by this award ceremony is not \"How good do you have to be to get a nomination?\" but \"How bad do you have to be not to get a nomination?\" The answer to that question for musicals is: hit rock bottom, and keep going. Every musical of the season, from a bus-and-truck \"Peter Pan\" to \"Shogun: The Musical\" to \"Oh, Kay!\" is in contention somewhere on the ballot. Among the season\\'s plays, only \"Zoya\\'s Apartment,\" \"Stand-Up Tragedy,\" \"The Big Love,\" \"Taking Steps\" and \"Mule Bone\" failed to be cited for so much as best sound design. (Actually, best sound design is not a category, but it should be, if only to encourage producers to make their shows audible rather than merely loud.)',\n",

The prewar Wolfschmidt has long since run out, but imported vodka is now a $700 million business -- and one of the few expanding segments of a declining liquor industry. First came the Soviet Union\\'s Stolichnaya, whose success begat Absolut, the Swedish vodka with the clever advertising campaign and the spiffy bottle. Suddenly, Scandinavian was chic, and the super-premium category witnessed a Nordic onslaught on a scale not seen since the Vikings swooped down on Europe in the ninth century. One after another, new vodkas descended from the frozen north, enswirled in a dry-ice fog: Finlandia (Finland), Elduris and Icy (Iceland), Denaka and Danzka (Denmark).',\n",

Some 2,000 years ago, during the Iron Age in northern Europe, hundreds of people -- most of them men -- were sacrificed and then dumped into peat bogs, where the acids tanned their bodies, dyed their hair red and sometimes preserved their stomachs, complete with their last meal. A few decades ago, many of them were unearthed by peat cutters. And now these deflated balloons of flesh, these sad sacks, have become storybook heroes. They have insinuated themselves into short stories, novels and poems across the English-speaking world, and not just as creeps from the muck -- these are not bogymen, after all -- but as true romantic figures, even sex symbols: the limp, silent type.',\n",

After touching these issues to both serious and comic effect in his earlier work, Mr. Lee with this latest film has driven to their core. Hawkins was not shot, after all, because he crossed the line into a white neighborhood; he was shot because he was mistaken for being the companion of a local girl who was considered a pariah for dating blacks and Hispanics. And in the art Mr. Lee has forged from reality, the threatening prospect of interracial intimacy is embodied by Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes), a married architect, and Angie Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), the temporary secretary who becomes his lover.',\n",

I live in a very old apartment, and the three walls that surround my bathtub were long ago covered with a type of wallboard that has an imitation tile pattern on the surface. This has been painted over many times, and now the paint is starting to flake off on the lower 18 inches around all three sides. Can you tell me how to eliminate this flaking condition and make the paint to adhere after I repaint? A. This type of hardboard originally had a very slick glossy finish on it, and paint does not usually adhere well to it if the surface is not properly prepared. The reason most of the flaking is on the lower part is probably because the moisture tends to creep up from the edges of the tub. To solve the problem, you should scrape and sand off all the loose or flaking paint. Then sand the exposed tile board with a medium-grit No. 80 paper. Dust thoroughly. Apply one coat of a shellac-based primer like BIN or Enamelac. Then apply two coats of alkyd enamel, sanding lightly between coats.',\n",

This has been painted over many times, and now the paint is starting to flake off on the lower 18 inches around all three sides. Can you tell me how to eliminate this flaking condition and make the paint to adhere after I repaint? A. This type of hardboard originally had a very slick glossy finish on it, and paint does not usually adhere well to it if the surface is not properly prepared. The reason most of the flaking is on the lower part is probably because the moisture tends to creep up from the edges of the tub. To solve the problem, you should scrape and sand off all the loose or flaking paint. Then sand the exposed tile board with a medium-grit No. 80 paper. Dust thoroughly. Apply one coat of a shellac-based primer like BIN or Enamelac. Then apply two coats of alkyd enamel, sanding lightly between coats.',\n",

In one of these short stories, an East Coast banker takes an emergency trip to the family spread in Montana, where his widowed mother has just married one of the ranch hands.

I live in a very old apartment, and the three walls that surround my bathtub were long ago covered with a type of wallboard that has an imitation tile pattern on the surface. This has been painted over many times, and now the paint is starting to flake off on the lower 18 inches around all three sides. Can you tell me how to eliminate this flaking condition and make the paint to adhere after I repaint? A. This type of hardboard originally had a very slick glossy finish on it, and paint does not usually adhere well to it if the surface is not properly prepared. The reason most of the flaking is on the lower part is probably because the moisture tends to creep up from the edges of the tub. To solve the problem, you should scrape and sand off all the loose or flaking paint. Then sand the exposed tile board with a medium-grit No. 80 paper. Dust thoroughly. Apply one coat of a shellac-based primer like BIN or Enamelac. Then apply two coats of alkyd enamel, sanding lightly between coats.',\n",

There were some nice small changes -- the infusion of colorful tweeds and plaids, for example, and the sway of flippy, pleated skirts. (Hemlines, however, stayed above the knee.) But coming on the heels of the forward-looking shows in Paris, the American shows for the most part lacked the slight silhouette changes and the imaginative accessorizing that nudge fashion forward. It was especially disappointing that several of the newer talents who had brought excitement to the last season settled for doing the same stuff over again in winter fabrics. The reluctance of so many American designers and manufacturers to go off into uncharted territories, though regrettable, was understandable. These collections had been produced amid the uncertainties of the Persian Gulf war. More important, the fact that the recession had already cut deeply into the retail and fashion industry and still showed no sign of receding made the status quo a safer route. Nevertheless, the majority of the new clothes were O.K. and, mercifully, from a store buyer's point of view, quite wearable.\",\n",

Without the Touraine, perhaps I could no longer live . . . .\" This passage, which goes on to evoke an idyllic village with turning water mills and hedges of honeysuckle, is from \"Le Lys Dans la Vallee\" by Balzac. It comes as a surprise to readers who know Balzac better as the cynical 19th-century chronicler of \"The Human Comedy,\" but here he is in lyrical mood: the countryside is transfigured by a passionate attachment. In the book, the young hero falls in love with Madame de Mortsauf, a beautiful married woman old enough to be his mother who, in the end, is destroyed by her own love for him. In life, the young Balzac fell in love with Madame de Bernay, a similar mother figure, who lived near Paris. But he himself came from the center of France and that region appears under one aspect or another in many of his books. Most frequent as settings are the Loire towns of Tours and Saumur; \"Le Lys Dans la Vallee,\" however, takes place a little farther south, in the true heart of France which lies between the vineyards of the Loire basin and the foothills of the Massif Central.',\n",

The Ainu were the original inhabitants of Hokkaido and adjacent islands, including the Kurile Islands. Over the centuries the Ainu people have mixed with the Japanese, and there are very few full-blooded Ainu people living today. On Hokkaido there are three re-created Ainu villages that teach visitors about Ainu history, crafts and customs. During the day, these villages are inhabited mainly by Ainu, but they do not live there full-time. The biggest such village is Shiraoi Ainu Kotan (kotan means village) in southern Hokkaido on the shore of Lake Poroto. Once the home of hundreds of Ainu, this village now contains an Ainu museum and re-creations of several thatched, rectangular Ainu houses. There are demonstrations of Ainu song, dance and crafts. The village is open daily, except Dec. 30 to Jan. 4, from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. April to October and 8 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. the rest of the year. Admission is $3.70. Shiraoi is 30 minutes by train from the Noboribetsu hot springs area (an hour and a half from Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital) or 30 minutes by bus from Tomakomai. At the site, the Shiraoi Dosanko Tanabata Matsuri Festival, with Ainu folk dancing, a parade and fireworks, takes place on the second weekend in August. The Chikabumi Ainu Kotan, in north central Hokkaido, has 70 Ainu houses where 300 people work, and an Ainu cemetery. There is no admission fee. The village is open Tuesday to Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sunday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. It is a 20-minute bus ride from the city of Asahigawa. In the mountains of eastern Hokkaido near Lake Akan is the Lake Akan Ainu Kotan. The village has a number of shops demonstrating the making of such crafts as carved wooden bears and selling them. There is a 30-minute folk dance demonstration, admission $4.50, at the Ainu Tourist Center several times a day. The village is open daily. A festivalOct. 8 to 10 draws several hundred people of Ainu ancestry. The village is about a two-hour drive from each of the two main cities in eastern Hokkaido, Abashiri and Kushiro. The Nifudani Ainu Cultural Museum, in the village of Nifudani along the Sarukawa River, is in an area said to be the cradle of Ainu culture, once containing many Ainu villages. The museum, telephone (0451) 2 2892, contains more than 1,000 Ainu tools and artifacts. It is open daily from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., and admission is $2.25. There was a group of Ainu on the Kurile Islands, but they were removed to Hokkaido when the Japanese were evacuated from the Kuriles after World War II. Butter Chicken in London Q. We became aficionados of butter chicken in India. We have been told there are restaurants in London that offer butter chicken but have never found any. Can you help? -- F. E. Wertheimer, New York, N.Y. A. Butter chicken, popular in New Delhi, is first cooked in a clay tandoor oven and then cut into pieces and further cooked in tomato puree thickened with cream and butter. The dish is commonly eaten with the hands along with one of several types of Indian bread. Butter chicken is offered at many of the Indian restaurants in London, but you might not have found it because it generally has other names. Among them are murgh makhani, chicken makhani, chicken tikka makhani or chicken tikka masala. The following restaurants serve butter chicken: Bombay Brasserie, Courtfield Close, Courtfield Road, Kensington; telephone (071) 370 4040. Buttered chicken appears on the menu as chicken tikka makhani, $13.65. Bhatti, 37 Great Queen Street, Holborn; (071) 831 0817. Buttered chicken is called chicken makhani, $10.45. Last Days of the Raj, 22 Drury Lane, Covent Garden; (071) 836 5705. Murgh massalam, a whole baby chicken, is $15.45, and chicken tikka masala, chicken off the bone, is $10.80. Taste of India, 25 Catherine Street, Covent Garden; (071) 836 2538. At this restaurant the dish is indeed called butter chicken and costs $12.65. Red Fort, 77 Dean Street, Soho; (071) 437 2115. Murgh makhani is $11.80. A Dutch Flower Festival Q. I understand there is a flower festival that occurs in the Netherlands every 10 years or so. When does it occur next? -- Darlene Kasten, Fanwood, N.J. A. The Floriade is a horticultural show that does indeed take place in the Netherlands every 10 years. The next Floriade will take place from April 10 to Oct. 11, 1992, in Zoetermeer, a town near The Hague. Work is in progress on a 180-acre site, where there will be a number of halls and greenhouses, outdoor display areas, shops, restaurants, old streetcars, boats, a monorail and a 228-foot observation tower. The Floriade displays will be grouped into seven themes: production, featuring cultivation methods and displaying a variety of bulbs, flowers, trees, plants and vegetables; consumer, with a variety of garden displays; environment, emphasizing water management; the future, emphasizing new breeding techniques and technology; world, with contributions from 20 countries, and recreation, with leisure activities for adults and children. After the Floriade, the area will be converted to a new borough of Zoetermeer and will contain 9,200 homes by the year 2000. Jogging in Paris Q. Are there safe areas in Paris frequented by joggers? Are there health clubs or gyms one can use for a fee? -- Helen Clay Chace, Mount Kisco, N.Y. A. Any of the smaller Parisian parks are safe for jogging during daylight: Parc Monceau (8th arrondissement), Parc Monsouris (14th), the Tuileries (1st), Parc des Buttes-Chaumont (19th) and the Luxembourg Garden (6th). The Bois de Vincennes, off the eastern edge of Paris and the Bois de Boulogne, on the west, are much bigger and largely safe, but during the week they are less frequented by joggers than the others. If you have any concerns, those two parks are much busier on the weekend. The path around the lake in the Bois de Boulogne, is especially popular for jogging then. As for fitness clubs, the Gymnase Club is the largest organization in Paris, with 10 centers around the city. The central telephone number is 45.74.37.17. A $45 fee allows one to buy 10 tickets for $100, each good for one use of a club and valid for one year.\",\n",

While there, the father (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decides to prolong the experience by staying on in the theme park after closing time. He and his wife and their daughter camp on Tom Sawyer\\'s Island, and the couple have a romantic interlude in the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse. As might be expected, the reckless idyll ends disastrously. But within months the family has become fabled among other homeless people as the ones who lived at Disneyland. This is the fanciful but grim beginning of Jane Anderson\\'s \"Food and Shelter,\" at the Vineyard Theater. At the outset Ms. Anderson sets her polarities: the magical though manufactured kingdom against the dreariness of those whose only residence is a car and whose life is otherwise circumscribed by food stamps and soup kitchens. If the playwright had been able to sustain the initial feelings aroused by her work, this might have been a disturbing portrait of what it means to be down and falling out in recession-struck America.',\n",

The steamy syncopation zone that stretches from Memphis to Rio de Janiero and from Andalusa to Cape Town - with Brooklyn and Paris as honorary Caribbean and African outposts - generates music that sounds its best when the temperature rises. As long as you're already sweating, you might as well dance. For the last few years, New York's best place for musical hot fun in the summertime has been the Summerstage series at Rumsey Playfield behind the Band Shell in Central Park at 70th Street - free outdoor concerts by some of the world's most exuberant bands, drawing some of the city's most variegated crowds to a place where there's plenty of room to stand up and shimmy under the stars (or streetlights). Among the highlights of this year's series are Olodum, the powerhouse percussion band from Bahia, Brazil, on June 16; the Menphis soul and gospel of Al Green on June 22; a merengue double bill with accordion-driven tipico (traditional) style by Fefita la Brande, and modern big-band merengue by La Gran Manzana on June 23; post-punk, post-Marxist, skewed British country rock by the Mekons on June 29; traditionalist Mexican-American songs by Los Lobos (playing acoustic instruments) on June 30; raw Chicago blues by Li'l Ed and the Blues Imperials and heartfelt soul by Otis Clay on July 20; reggae by Sister Carol on July 21; and rock and roll piano by Johnnie Johnson, Chuck Berry's pianist, on Aug. 3, and Zairean soukous by the guitarist Dirlo Dirala and his band on Aug. 4. There's also a benefit concert ($15 in advance, $17 on the day of the show) by the New Orleans rhythm masters the Neville Brothers on June 26; information: Ticketmaster (212) 307-7171. Dancers who prefer a little air conditioning can follow tropical syncopations indoors. In downtown Manhattan, Sounds of Brazil, 204 Varick Street, (212) 243-4940, presents Brazilian, Caribbean, African and New York bands - everything from reggae to Zairean soukous to Haitian compas to rap -in intimate, sometimes cramped quarters for a crowd that mixes tourists and afficionados; better-known bands often play on weekdays rather than weekends. Kilimanjaro, 531 West 19th Street, (212) 627-2333, presents Caribbean, African and New York bands on one floor, with different dance music upstairs, and has a bigger dance floor and a higher stage (for better visibility) than Sounds of Brazil, although its show times are less reliable. No alcohol is served. Club Broadway, 2551 Broadway, at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600, is a center for salsa - rumbas, mambos, guarachas, cha-chas and the rest of the Cuban- Puerto Rican-New York rhythmic constellation. A primarily Latin crowd dresses in its spiffiest outfits - formal gowns for the women, suits or other finery for the men - to dance into the wee hours with double and triple bills of the top performers on the salsa circuit; mirrored walls double the glamour. Studio 84, 3534 Broadway at 14th Street, (212) 926-2424, with its long tables and mirrored balls hanging from the ceiling, is the Dominican equivalent of Club Broadway, with the galloping rhythms of up to four different merengue bands through the night. Neither club is cheap; along with admission prices that may be as high as $30 a person, groups are expected to buy a bottle of liquor at a considerable markup. Sneakers and blue jeans are frowned upon by the doorkeepers. But these are places in Manhattan where tropical rhythms find the dancers they were made for.\",\n",

It is either a stark spectacle that probes the human condition or the world\\'s most boring ballet. But the piece re-entered the City Ballet repertory, on Friday night at the New York State Theater, in a performance that underscored its virtues. This was due in large part to the performance of Jean Guizerix, a principal dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet whom Mr. Robbins invited to dance the lead role. In some lights, Mr. Guizerix bears a facial resemblance to Edward Villella, for whom the ballet was created. Mr. Villella brought a charismatic intensity to the role, seeming to rein in his gutsy attack and presence for the part. Mr. Guizerix has a quieter, more modest presence in the role, but he remains a potent center throughout the ballet, even when lying to the side in shadows in a sea of evocative sounds created by Teiji Ito\\'s score for wooden flute, bells and other ancient Oriental instruments.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'ALL New Yorkers want a private beach. They want to flip-flop down a lonely path, unfold their chairs or spread their towels on an empty patch of sand, and bask in the security of isolation. Certainly a public beach is a more perilous prospect. One risks being boinged by a stray paddle ball or sprinkled with sand as some carefree teen-ager races past. One risks empty Coke cans in the sand, and having one\\'s physical imperfections exposed to strangers. One risks humanity, perhaps throngs of it, all united in the same democratic pursuit of sun, open air, the smell of salt water, the song of crashing surf. Yet public beaches offer pleasures that no private beach can rival. There is junk food, sumptuous arrays of it, from french fries to pretzels to lemony Italian ices to Good Humor ice cream; the feel of a Popsicle stick against the tongue captures the essence of summer. There are boardwalks, those casual roadways of beach traffic that never stray off a parallel line with the water\\'s edge. There are brawny dudes and voluptuous babes, all wearing bathing suits more outrageous and colorful than you\\'d ever dare. Public beaches offer an unusual and intriguing sense of community: impervious to class, race or income, they encourage you to drown your identity in an ocean of bodies, coconut oil, laughter and warmth. From Astroland amusement park at Coney Island to the terrace at Orchard Beach, New York City\\'s public beaches present a rare opportunity for adventure. Early architecture and old-fashioned signs allow a glimpse into the past, while the weathered snack shacks and sturdy, well-kept boardwalks bring it smoothly into the present. These beaches are more than just sand and surf; they\\'re culture, experience, a history of a city at play. Brighton Beach 2.5 miles, on the Atlantic Ocean, from Brighton 15th Street to West 37th Street, Brooklyn, (718) 946-1350. ATMOSPHERE: Brighton Beach is from another place, another time. It has a ghostly, romantic quality that comes as much from the old apartment buildings and slightly run-down seaside concession stands as from the aging Soviet emigres who wander the boardwalk, murmuring in their native tongue. The ocean view stretches all the way to the horizon, suggesting distant lands. PEOPLE: Predominantly Soviet immigrants, many of them over age 50. Men with white chest hair and straw fedoras; women wearing kerchiefs on their heads and embroidered sweaters. To shade themselves from the sun, the men wear white noseguards; the women simply hold their purses or newspapers above their heads. SAND: Hazardous -- broken glass, jagged pieces of shells, bottle tops. But then, the beach itself isn\\'t really the point here. SURF: Swimming isn\\'t the point, either. BOARDWALK: The center of activity. People gossip and philosophize, walking with unhurried steps or perched on benches like pigeons on a wire. Riegelmann Boardwalk continues all the way to Coney Island (a 10-to-15-minute walk), and the barren frame of the Parachute Jump is clearly visible in the distance. A plank mural between the two beaches asks rhetorical questions like \"Will listening to the ocean add years to your life?\" and \"Did it rain yesterday?\" MUSIC: Ethnic folk songs with people dancing and clapping along; gentlemen serenading their lady friends with 1940\\'s pop ballads played on tinny portable radios. FOOD: Signs with old-fashioned lettering announce \"Hirsch\\'s Knishes,\" \"Filipp\\'s Cafe,\" \"Gastronom Moscow.\" Faded Pepsi logos, plastic chairs and tables with umbrellas. The Boardwalk Cafe doubles as a grocery store, with petrified-looking seafood in glass cases and canned goods with labels in Russian. ARCADE: None; too modern a concept. DIVERSIONS: Playground and tennis courts nearby. One mysterious building is labeled \"B A DW LK MENS LUB,\" with a crooked \"For Members Only\" sign hanging in the dark entrance. NEIGHBORHOOD: Bustling street with discount stores and coffee shops in the shadow of elevated subway tracks. CLAIM TO FAME: Neil Simon\\'s \"Brighton Beach Memoirs.\" Orchard Beach 1.1 miles, on Long Island Sound in Pelham Bay Park, the Bronx, (212) 885-2275. ATMOSPHERE: Seriously beachy. Orchard Beach is New York City\\'s last resort; at the turn of the century, it was a popular bathing spot for the affluent residents of Pelham Manor. A large, luxurious stand of trees skirts the beach, giving the place a feeling of anti-urban festivity. From a patio vantage point between the two halves of the old bathhouse, one can gaze over the entire expanse of sand and see people, umbrellas and bathers dotting the shore, as idyllic as on a picture postcard. PEOPLE: A vibrant, ethnically mixed crowd -- children with their hair tied back with uninflated balloons, raucous teen-agers in bikinis and knee-length trunks, young families on outings. SAND: Relatively clean and deep. SURF: Pretty lame. Orchard Beach fronts on Long Island Sound, so there are virtually no waves. At low tide the water dissolves into muddy pebbly puddles. BOARDWALK: Broad concrete walkway partly shaded by trees and perfect for ogling; brawny, sly-faced men sit on the backs of benches and grin at passers-by. MUSIC: Salsa, urban dance hits, Madonna booming out of complex, multiple-component radios. FOOD: The shopping-mall approach to dining. Two open-air food courts with a melting pot of ethnic selections -- Spanish, Greek and Italian cafes, Texas barbecue, raw bar and chowder, even a \"Coney Island\" vendor with hot dogs and fries. Booths inside, tables with red-and-yellow-striped umbrellas outside. ARCADE: Yes. DIVERSIONS: Basketball and handball courts, volleyball nets, playground; the Kazimiroff Nature Trail, a hike winding through 189 acres; a swamp-grassy area between trees with a sign that boasts \"Natural Meadow.\" NEIGHBORHOOD: None. No buildings, houses or sidewalks. Orchard Beach is approachable only by lush, green, tree-lined lanes that serve to separate it physically and psychically from the grim heat wave and hustle one is leaving behind. CLAIM TO FAME: The sand came from New Jersey in the 1930\\'s, on barges. Rockaway Beach 7.5 miles, on the Atlantic Ocean from Beach First Street, Far Rockaway, to Beach 149th Street, Neponsit, Queens (718) 318-4000. ATMOSPHERE: Unlike the other public beaches, Rockaway has no distinctive New York flavor; its plain plank boardwalk, pale arc of sand and high-rise condos are welcoming enough, but they could just as easily belong to Long Island, Virginia or any other point on the East Coast. That\\'s not to say it\\'s without character. The beautiful old buildings, nearby hotels and ornate subway station have a kind of windswept, sunburned grandeur, and the fact that it\\'s accessible only by bridge gives it the aura of adventure and isolation. PEOPLE: Suburban teen-agers, office workers in their 20\\'s, bored-looking mothers, dogs with names like Champ. SAND: Soft and dross-free close to the boardwalk. Below tide level, strewn with shells, pull tabs, some glass, the occasional broken toy. SURF: Glorious. BOARDWALK: Called Ocean Promenade. Nondescript. A few old-timers are scattered on benches. MUSIC: INXS, Whitney Houston, other pop and rock hitmakers. FOOD: The Sand Bar, an open-air, garagelike space with a fast-food counter on one side, a square bar serving draft beer in 32-ounce cups on the other. ARCADE: Situated in a row of buildings just off the boardwalk, but boarded up, apparently for ages. \"It never opens,\" a woman at the food counter said sadly. DIVERSIONS: Playground at the opposite end of the boardwalk from the main entrance. NEIGHBORHOOD: The center of town is a cute small-business district, but the area closer to the beach has the gaunt, washed-out look of a summer community long past its prime. Cracked and peeling sign boards, rubble-filled lots; ghost buildings like Danny\\'s Cocktail Lounge, with its shadowy interior musty and decayed from disuse, and the Hotel Lawrence, a once-gorgeous structure whose upstairs porch has fallen into seedy disrepair. CLAIM TO FAME: \"Rockaway Beach,\" by the Ramones. Manhattan Beach 0.3 mile, on the Atlantic Ocean, Oriental Boulevard, from Ocean Avenue to Mackenzie Street, Brooklyn, (718) 946-1373. ATMOSPHERE: A beach in the most generic sense of the word. Sand, jetties, picnic areas, ocean. PEOPLE: Homeboys, teen-age girls with big hair, screaming children. SAND: Well tended up to the tide line, where there are unnervingly large piles of debris -- twigs, driftwood, even a section of a picket fence. SURF: Calm. BOARDWALK: None -- just a cement sidewalk that curves around the short strip of sand. MUSIC: Funk, rock. FOOD: The sign on the building just reads \"Food Concession\" in big block letters. ARCADE: None. DIVERSIONS: Basketball courts. OTHER BUILDINGS: The bathhouse is a rectangular tan-brick structure that looks like an Army barracks, except for the maple-leaf logo of the Parks and Recreation Department on the front. NEIGHBORHOOD: Nice middle-class houses on a two-lane road. CLAIM TO FAME: President Ulysses S. Grant dedicated the Manhattan Beach Hotel in 1877; it was demolished in World War I. Coney Island 2.5 miles, on the Atlantic Ocean, from West 37th Street to Corbin Place, Brooklyn, (718) 946-1350. ATMOSPHERE: A seemingly endless stretch of sand, a Boardwalk offering every possible greasy food, water-squirt games, a roller coaster that defines the term death-defying, a Ferris wheel you can see from miles away at night, carnival music, the world\\'s best hot dog, cheap beer, buildings saddened by decay, a century\\'s worth of memories -- Coney Island has everything a beach could ever dream of. And more: Coney Island has presence, life, a tingling timelessness in its air that penetrates your skin faster and more deeply than a ray of sun. Its wondrous and strange history is horribly apparent in the crumbling walls of its old bathhouses, in its chipped tiles and peeling paint, in the blackened corpse of the Thunderbolt roller coaster. Yet even though it\\'s lost much of its grandeur, it seems, today, somehow richer for it. Coney Island has seen more than any human being ever will. It has soul. PEOPLE: Black, white, Puerto Rican, Asian, Indian, yuppie, drifter, tourist, hipster, lonely heart, crazy drunk, anyone and everyone. SAND: Take off your shoes and feel it under your feet. SURF: Venerable. BOARDWALK: Epochal. Souvenirs like pinwheels and inflatable toys, spillover from Ruby\\'s bar and restaurant; a view of the teeming amusement park to one side, the ocean and infinite horizon to the other. MUSIC: Rap from the Break Dance ride, organ from the carousel, soft rock from Ruby\\'s, and disco from boom boxes all mingle with the shrieks and thunder of the Cyclone. FOOD: Coney Island is proud of its junk food. Gregory & Paul\\'s, the snack joint on the Boardwalk with the Astroland rocket on top, has signs that brag of \"hygrade frankfurters, hamburgers, french fries, hot corn, Italian sausage, seafood, frog legs, fried shrimp, cold beer, drinks, popcorn, cotton candy, ice cream, hot knishes, hot pizza, coffee cake, Italian ices, fried chicken.\" ARCADE: Faber\\'s Fascination Sportland, Astroland Arcade, among other thrills. NEIGHBORHOOD: Tawdry, desperate. On Neptune Avenue, east of Astroland, a vacant lot is set off from the road by a chain-link fence. A small, innocuous Parks and Recreation sign bears the inscription Steeplechase Park, on the site of the park that closed in 1964. ADDED ATTRACTIONS: Sideshows by the Seashore, a museum, theater and sometime live-music venue. Recently renovated, it houses photos of freaks, memorabilia and other tributes to Coney\\'s past lives. CLAIM TO FAME: The most renowned and infamous beach in the world, perhaps of all history; a place where one is free, briefly, to melt time. NO SAND, NO SALTY TANG, BUT WATER, REFRESHING WATER All outdoor pools listed are open 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily, with free admission, unless otherwise noted. Under Mayor David N. Dinkins\\'s proposed city budget, the pools would be open from July 4 through Aug. 18. They would remain open longer only if the city receives private donations to cover the costs of staff and maintenance. Brooklyn BETSY HEAD, Hopkinson and Dumont Avenues, Brownsville, (718) 965-6581.

Mr. Peirce said that with six lanes and two covered sidewalks for drop-offs, the figure might become 20 vehicles a minute.',\n",

Like a chubby-cheeked choirboy lifting an open hymnal, he raises the black Wilson mitt on his left hand to a resting place in front of his solemn game face. After a gentle rock backward, he reaches into his glove, as if to remove a bookmark, grasps the ball and, with a grimace and a grunt, commences the same windup that he had rehearsed before a full-length mirror after every Little League game. Clemens is a 6-foot-4-inch time machine, a throwback to an era when uniforms were baggy and throwing hard was everything, when the guy hurtling thunderbolts down from the mound was Cy Young or Walter Johnson or Bob Feller. His high hard ones rip across the ages, punching holes in fancy hitting theories and computerized strategies. In 1986, he struck out 20 batters in a single game, a major-league record. Grab a bat and feel the heat. Crowd the plate and he'll brush you back easy as spit. If the opposing pitcher plunks one of his mates, Clemens'll nail the next batter he faces. He even has a good old-fashioned monicker: the Rocket.\",\n",

This has been painted over many times, and now the paint is starting to flake off on the lower 18 inches around all three sides. Can you tell me how to eliminate this flaking condition and make the paint to adhere after I repaint? A. This type of hardboard originally had a very slick glossy finish on it, and paint does not usually adhere well to it if the surface is not properly prepared. The reason most of the flaking is on the lower part is probably because the moisture tends to creep up from the edges of the tub. To solve the problem, you should scrape and sand off all the loose or flaking paint. Then sand the exposed tile board with a medium-grit No. 80 paper. Dust thoroughly. Apply one coat of a shellac-based primer like BIN or Enamelac. Then apply two coats of alkyd enamel, sanding lightly between coats.',\n",

But until now, too many of his songs have seemed slight and undeveloped. His new album, \"Life\\'s Too Short\" (MCA), changes that, with lyrics that are just a little more explicit about romantic strife. At the Village Gate on Wednesday night, Mr. Crenshaw\\'s new songs illuminated his old ones, proving that his easygoing tunes always harbored a distrust of pop\\'s promise that love conquers all. Leading a five-piece band that included Mitch Easter, a noted pop-rock producer, on guitar, Mr. Crenshaw sang unforced melodies and tossed off concise guitar riffs. He chose from among his best old songs (like \"Someday, Some Way,\" more desperate than it sounds), tough new ones (\"Don\\'t Disappear Now\") and covers that were tributes to influences, like the Byrds\\' \"Have You Seen Her Face,\" or obscure finds, like the Tall Dwarfs\\' neo-psychedelic \"Face of Fashion.\"',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'Like many high school juniors, I just took the Scholastic Aptitude Test. I emerged from the three-and-one-half-hour ordeal struck by the too large number of questions that emphasized the achievements of minorities, women and third world countries; bemoaned the shortcomings of American society, and advanced fashionable causes. That such causes are presented in what is supposed to be an objective test is surprising; that they are advanced in a way that ultimately compromises them is sad. The questions [ verified with the Educational Testing Service last week ] informed us that the writer Zora Neale Hurston had been exposed to black folklore at an early age; that \"Invisible Man\" by Ralph Ellison was considered a great book when it was published and probably will always be considered one, and that \"The Piano Lesson\" by August Wilson chronicles his experience and is set in Pittsburgh. So far, so good. There\\'s nothing wrong with references to the lives of writers or a celebration of their works. As it happens, I admire these writers. The problem is that the unrelieved piling up of such citations amounted to a racial focus of skewed proportions. The questions cited Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry and Jackie Robinson, twice. It seemed as if almost half the questions that named real people named blacks. Furthermore, the fiction-reading comprehension section was from Maya Angelou\\'s \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" The Educational Testing Service also took pains to focus on other minorities. There were questions about Mexican Americans, native Americans and Eskimos. And, as a nod to third world supporters, the test mentioned Zimbabwe\\'s celebration in 1982 of its second year of independence. Other questions emphasized women. Doris Lessing, we were reminded, is the 20th century\\'s Jane Austen. There was a reading-comprehension section about the English author Fanny Wright and her book about the early U.S. -- a book, we were told, that recognized some of the country\\'s problems but failed to understand how difficult solutions would be. I, too, think that recycling paper is a good idea. But when a question that mentions white men stresses Theodore Roosevelt\\'s contribution to wilderness conservation, and a reading-comprehension passage speaks of delicate lake ecosystems, it all begins to seem a bit simple-minded. Stung by criticism that the S.A.T. has been culturally biased, the E.T.S. has, it seems, tried to redeem itself and perhaps avert future criticism by emphasizing the achievements of minorities and women. The trouble is that this emphasis reveals as much about stereotypical thinking as anything could and may well offend many students -- minority and majority, male and female -- who take the test. African-Americans, women and Asians should complain because the E.T.S., in so pointedly turning stereotypes upside down, highlights them. Jews should complain because Albert Einstein and Saul Bellow seem not to be subjects of questions. Men should complain because they rarely seem to achieve anything unless they\\'re of minority origin. Everyone should complain because, in one way or another, the S.A.T. distorts reality. This imbalance reflects a conformism that is prevalent in America and that hurts all of us, particularly those whose causes it seeks to advance. By painting reality in the hues of wishful thinking, it lulls us into believing serious inequities have been set right, and it strangles the openness, dynamism and complexity that define and give hope to our still evolving, ever more inclusive democracy.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'The House will vote, probably on Tuesday, on civil rights legislation dealing with job discrimination. Three bills will be considered: one sponsored by members of the Black Caucus, one backed by the Democratic leadership and some Republicans, and President Bush\\'s bill. DISPARATE IMPACT Suits involving hiring or promotion practices, like tests, that are apparently fair on their face but have a \"disparate impact\" -- resulting in the hiring, for example, of proportionately more whites than blacks or more men than women -- are sometimes called \"unintentional discrimination\" cases. There are major differences on how each stage of such cases should be handled. Issue: How specific do complainants have to be in court? In the 1989 Wards Cove v. Atonio case, the Supreme Court said it would be unfair to employers to allow complainants to attack a group of practices and assert that their cumulative effect was discriminatory. Black Caucus: Complainants can demonstrate that a \"group of employment practices\" caused a discriminatory result. Democrats: Complainants must cite a specific practice, or practices, unless a court finds that despite a \"diligent effort,\" that is an impossible burden, as when, for example, an employer had not kept records. Bush: A specific practice, or practices, would have to be cited. Issue: Who has the burden of proof, the employer or the employee? In the Wards Cove case, the Supreme Court held that once complainants had shown, usually through statistics, that a \"disparate impact\" had resulted from an employment practice, the complainants still had the burden of proof of showing that the employer had no business necessity for the practice. Black Caucus: Once a \"disparate impact\" is shown, the burden of proof shifts to the employer, on the ground that the employer, not the complainant, is in the best position to know why a practice is necessary. Democrats: The same. Bush: The same. Issue: What kind of \"business necessity\" can legitimize a practice that screens out women and minorities? In Wards Cove, the Supreme Court ruled that an employment practice with apparent discriminatory effect can be justified if it \"serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer.\" It need not be either \"essential\" or \"indispensable.\" The Wards Cove definition is easier for employers to meet than the definition set in the 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power Co. Under Griggs, employers had to show that the practice had a \"manifest relationship to the employment in question,\" focusing more narrowly on the job at issue rather than the employers\\' overall business concerns. Democrats say a loose definition would encourage discrimination; the White House contends that a definition that makes business necessity difficult to prove would lead employers to use quotas rather than risk losing lawsuits. Black Caucus: Employers would have to prove that a challenged practice \"bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job performance.\" Democrats: Employers must prove that the practice has a \"significant and manifest relationship to the requirements for effective job performance.\" Those requirements include not only \"effective performance of the actual work activities\" but also \"factors which bear on such performance, such as attendance, punctuality and not engaging in misconduct or insubordination.\" Bush: Employers would have their choice of proving either \"legitimate employment goals,\" as in Wards Cove case or the \"manifest relationship\" rule from Griggs. \"QUOTAS\" Issue: The use of numerical quotas in hiring or promotion is generally prohibited. Affirmative actions plans that involve less specific goals and timetables and require employers to make greater efforts to hire and promote women and minorities are generally acceptable. Precise quotas are sometimes acceptable if they are imposed by court order against an employer found to have consistently discriminated in the past. The White House says that the way the Democrats would outlaw quotas would really encourage their use because the Democrats define quotas in a narrow way. Black Caucus: No provision. Democrats: Bill states that it does not \"require or encourage or permit\" quotas. It also makes their use an \"illegal employment practice\" under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Someone denied hiring or promotion because of a quota could sue to get the job and seek damages too. Quotas are defined as the setting of \"a fixed number or percentage of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex or national origin which must be attained, or which cannot be exceeded, regardless of whether such persons meet necessary qualifications to perform the job.\" Bush: No direct reference to quotas. DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT Issue: In the 1989 Patterson v. McLean Credit Union case, the Supreme Court held that the right to sue for damages for racial job discrimination under an 1866 law did not apply to on-the-job harassment or other forms of discrimination after someone was hired. Since then, lower courts have disagreed as to whether the law applies to dismissals, promotions and other practices. Black Caucus: The Patterson decision would be rejected absolutely, and the Reconstruction-era law would be clearly defined as applying to hirings, promotions, dismissals and all other terms of employment. Democrats: The same. In addition, this proposal makes clear that the provision applies to nongovernmental discrimination as well as discrimination based on state law. Bush: Identical with Democratic version. Issue: Victims of intentional discrimination or harassment based on sex, religion, national origin or disability are protected under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, not the 1866 law. All a judge can order is back pay and employment or reinstatement on a job if it was lost. Compensatory and punitive damages are not permitted, and women argue that their claims under this act therefore have less weight Black Caucus: Amend the 1866 law so that it also covers sex discrimination. Amend the 1964 law to allow compensatory and punitive damages. Either side could request trial by jury. Democrats: Amend the 1964 law to permit suits for compensatory and punitive damages and back pay. Punitive damages would be limited to $150,000, or the total of back pay and compensatory damages, whichever is higher. Because that would still be less than victims of racial discrimination can seek under the 1866 law, the provision has been attacked as unfair, to women in particular. If either side asked, the case would be tried before a jury. Bush: Damages would be allowed only in harassment cases, including sexual harassment, and no more than $150,000 in damages would be allowed. But a victim could not sue if he or she had failed to use in-house grievance procedures. The case would be tried before a judge without a jury. Victims of other sorts of intentional discrimination would still be entitled only to back pay and employment or reinstatement. REOPENING OLD DISCRIMINATION CASES Issue: In the 1989 Martin v. Wilks case, the Supreme Court ruled that since some white firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., had not been parties to two earlier suits challenging discrimination in the city\\'s fire department, they had a right to go into court later to attack hiring and promotion policies established by consent decrees that settled the suits. Black Caucus: People could not sue to reopen employment cases if they had \"actual notice\" of the decree at the time it was entered and a \"reasonable opportunity\" to object. Nor could they sue if their interests \"were adequately represented\" in the original case. Challenges would also not be allowed \"if reasonable efforts were made to provide notice to interested persons.\" Democrats: The same. Bush: Endorses the Martin v. Wilks decision; would write it into a statute. ADJUSTMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT TESTS Issue: In a practice called \"race norming,\" the Labor Department has urged state employment services to score the results of a widely used aptitude test separately for white, blacks and people of Hispanic descent. Under this practice, in effect since the beginning of the Reagan Administration, some blacks with low raw scores of correct answers are rated higher than some whites with more correct answers. Black Caucus: No provision. Democrats: Prohibit both \"race norming\" and the use of biased employment tests that fail to predict job performance equally well, regardless of race, religion, sex or national origin. Bush: Would prohibit \"race norming.\"',\n",

The war that President Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney authorized against Iraq was much more than a war to limit military reinforcements from reaching Iraq\\'s forces in Kuwait. The systematic destruction of the electric-power plants and water utilities of Iraq constituted an assault on the civilian population. What we have done guaranteed the epidemic spread of disease from polluted water and a lack of the hospital services necessary to deal with it. Transportation and even the harvesting of food in Iraq have been crippled by the destruction of oil refineries. Outside aid is urgently needed. We violated international law in our assault on civilian life in Iraq, and few people have the courage to tell this to the American public and to point out our moral obligation to act quickly and adequately to reduce the predicted toll of 170,000 more child deaths. There is, to put it bluntly, no moral leadership in Washington, or in the news media, if the horror that we have created is swept under the carpet.FREDERICK S.

With the band, Mr. Hakmoun plucked fast, propulsive modal riffs on an electrified sintir (a cello-like lute) and sang Arab-inflected melodies, often in fiery call-and-response with Said Hakmoun or with Radouane Laktib, who played an 11-string Moroccan mandolin. The band pushed the songs toward a raw kind of funk; as the momentum built, the Hakmoun brothers put down their instruments and danced, leaping as if the stage were a trampoline.',\n",

The $51.9 billion budget, the latest in New York State history, will affect life in the state in countless small ways -- and in many large ones. Its impact will be felt directly in increased parking fines, in larger class sizes at public schools and in longer lines at the Motor Vehicles Department. And indirectly the budget is very likely to lead to higher local taxes and to cutbacks at locally run parks, centers for the elderly and youth programs.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': \"A year and a half after lethal mail bombs were delivered to judicial and civil rights targets in the South, a Georgia man with a longstanding obsession with the legal system goes on trial in St. Paul on Tuesday, accused of killing a Federal judge and a civil rights lawyer. The man, Walter Leroy Moody Jr. of Rex, Ga., faces 71 Federal counts, including murder and conspiracy, in connection with the mailing of four nail-studded mail bombs in December 1989. Two bombs sent through the mail exploded and killed Judge Robert S. Vance of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit at his home in Birmingham, Ala., and Robert E. Robinson, a civil rights lawyer and a City Alderman in Savannah, Ga. Two other bombs, one sent to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Jacksonville, Fla., and the other to the offices of the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, were defused. Jury selection begins Tuesday in St. Paul. The case, in which Mr. Moody faces up to a potential life sentence on each of four counts and up to 20 years on each of the 67 other counts, was moved there after his lawyers said widespread publicity about the case in the South made a fair trial impossible. Mr. Moody is charged with the murder of a judge, civil rights violations in connection with Mr. Robinson's death, attempted murder of Federal court personnel, illegally transporting explosives, and a variety of other crimes in connection with the mailing of the four bombs, one tear-gas canister, and nearly three dozen letters threatening judges, lawyers and others. Because of the nature of the targets and letters to an Atlanta television station saying the incidents were in reprisal for the rape and murder of a white woman by a black man, officials originally believed that the incidents were racially motivated. But what has emerged is a picture of a suspect with a history of psychiatric problems and and of filing litigation and appeals, most of which eventually came before the 11th Circuit. Some officials have speculated that Mr. Moody's real grievance was with the appeals court and that the racial elements of the case were included only to divert attention from him. His lawyers had filed motions that would have allowed a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. But last month Mr. Moody, who abruptly withdrew an insanity plea in an earlier, unrelated Federal prosecution with alleged witness tampering in connection with a 1972 bombing, told his lawyers that he wanted to plead not guilty. His lawyers said they would try to prove that the Government had insufficient evidence to convict him. Mr. Moody, a 57-year-old self-employed literary consultant, originally became a suspect because of similarities between a bomb he was convicted of possessing in 1972 and the ones involved in the 1989 incidents. A crucial witness is expected to be Mr. Moody's second wife, Susan Moody, who divorced him last year. Officials have said Mrs. Moody has provided details about the assembly of bombs at their home and her part in buying materials for them. She has pleaded guilty to charges in the case. Mr. Moody's extensive involvement with the courts began with his 1972 conviction for possession a bomb that exploded in the hands of his first wife, Hazel Strickland. Mr. Moody, who spent two years in prison for the offense, is contesting the conviction.\",\n",

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia; Justice Scalia also filed a separate dissent.

The right-hander, who has been on a rehabilitation program since surgery on his pitching shoulder in March, had been expected to travel to Atlanta with the team, but was sent home instead. Also going home yesterday was Oakland catcher TERRY STEINBACH, who was discharged from a hospital in Chicago, two days after being beaned by White Sox pitcher BOBBY THIGPEN.

The Sharks acquired the veteran center in exchange for SHANE CHURLA, an enforcer who returns to the team that lost him to San Jose last week in a dispersal draft. Kisio, 31 years old, was hampered by injuries last season and managed just 15 goals and 20 assists in 51 games after seven consecutive 20-goal seasons. . . . In an exchange of defensive prospects, the New Jersey Devils yesterday acquired BRENT SEVERYN from the Quebec Nordiques for DAVE MARCINYSHYN. The 25-year-old Severyn, of Vegreville, Alberta, appeared in 50 games with the Halifax Citadels of the American Hockey League and recorded 7 goals, 26 assists and 202 penalty minutes. He has career N.H.L. totals of 35 games played with 2 assists for 2 points. . . . LOU LAMORIELLO, the president and general manager of the Devils, announced yesterday that the team has signed a new five-year contract with WABC Radio that will allow the 50,000-watt station to broadcast the Devils' games through the 1995-96 N.H.L. season.

Because Healthnet's managers and Shamrock propose converting Healthnet to a profit-making operation, the state agency must approve the transaction. Under California law, the money would go to a public trust. Healthnet's management is offering $15 million in cash and $93 million in notes.\",\n",

In any event, \"China Beach\" returns tonight at 10 with the first of seven episodes that are being broadcast for the first time. Fans have been waging a letter-writing campaign to get them shown. Their victory is limited. The widely acclaimed series is not on the ABC schedule for next season. The show returns in fine form, slipping seamlessly between two different time periods. It\\'s 1983 and Colleen McMurphy (Dana Delany) is in Portland, Ore., to be maid of honor at a wedding. A perceptive guy named Joe (Adam Arkin) introduces himself as the band\\'s drummer but later also turns out to be the best man. As the wedding preparations proceed, McMurphy has flashbacks to 1969 and her China Beach friends in Vietnam. An amateur production of \"My Fair Lady\" is being mounted, its familiar songs taking on new meanings as various romances ebb and flow.',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'Twenty-three years after a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons went into effect, France announced today that it would finally join the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and 139 other nations as a signer of the accord. The French announcement was coupled with a package of ambitious proposals for arms control worldwide, including calls for the destruction of chemical weapons, a ban on production of biological weapons, reduction of nuclear arsenals and negotiations to limit the multi-billion-dollar trade in conventional armaments. The plan was announced by President Francois Mitterrand just days after President Bush proposed a ban on weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. French officials said the two plans were complementary, although the French initiative favors a global approach to arms control. Both proposals are to be taken up in Paris this month at a meeting of arms control experts from the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. Officials said the French plan was conveyed to both President Bush and the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, over the weekend. French officials said Mr. Bush telephoned President Mitterrand to congratulate him on France\\'s decision to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The treaty, the subject of intensive negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the mid-1960\\'s, bans the export of nuclear weapons and nuclear arms technology. It emerged after the two superpowers and Britain in 1963 signed the first important arms control treaty, banning nuclear tests in outer space, the atmosphere and underwater. The treaty went into effect in 1968. Protecting a Monopoly The treaty was controversial because it sought to make permanent the nuclear weapons monopoly of those nations then possessing such weapons -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- and sought pledges from other countries not to acquire any. The treaty also committed the nuclear powers to work toward total nuclear disarmament and to help nonnuclear nations signing the accord in developing peaceful uses of nuclear energy. From the start, France and China refused to sign the treaty, although France has always insisted that it has adhered to its provisions. In refusing to sign, President Charles de Gaulle maintained that France was not adequately consulted by Washington and Moscow when the treaty was being negotiated. But France\\'s refusal was more broadly based, being part of de Gaulle\\'s wish to signal that France had its own foreign and defense policy. The same reasoning led de Gaulle to pull France out of NATO\\'s integrated military command in 1966. Today, French political experts said that non-adherence to the treaty had not only lost its usefulness as a symbol of France\\'s political independence, but could also weaken international support for the French disarmament proposal. In Bonn, a Government spokesman said today that Germany supported France\\'s initiative. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was personally briefed on it by Mr. Mitterrand last week. A British spokesman also welcomed France\\'s decision. The signing of the treaty by France will leave China as the only permament member of the Security Council not to have done so. The French disarmament plan was also sent to the Chinese Government over the weekend, but French officials who visited Beijing last month said China had given no indication that it might join the nonproliferation pact. India, which has exploded a nuclear device, and Pakistan, Israel, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil, countries thought to possess advanced nuclear technology, have also refused to sign. But most countries have accepted it, including nations like Iraq and North Korea that are believed to have ambitions of developing nuclear weapons. Western diplomats said that while the decision by France to sign the treaty was aimed at bolstering its arms control initiative, they considered it the major feature of the plan. \"It\\'s all part of France\\'s effort to position itself on the world stage after the gulf war,\" a diplomat said. As with the American plan announced last week by President Bush, Mr. Mitterrand\\'s move has been prompted by the Persian Gulf war and fears of a new postwar arms race, but it also reflects France\\'s embarrassment at having been the principal Western supplier of weapons to Iraq from 1975 to 1990. While France has called for global controls on weapons production and transfers, however, the American plan focuses only on the Middle East, contemplating a freeze and eventual ban on ballistic missiles, a ban on biological weapons, an end to production of materiel that could be used for nuclear weapons and guidelines on transfers of conventional weapons. \"Our objectives are clear,\" the French statement said. \"Chemical arms should be eliminated. Bacteriological arms should not be produced. Nuclear arsenals should be brought down to the lowest possible levels compatible with dissuasion. Nonproliferation of nuclear arms remains imperative.\" On conventional weapons, France adopted a British proposal for establishment of a registry of arms sales at the United Nations and it proposed negotiations to achieve \"a balance of forces\" in all regions of the world. Borrowing from the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it suggested that different regions should adopt such confidence-building measures as the exchange of military information and set up agencies to monitor weapons. French officials emphasized that France was not trying to establish a weapons monopoly for the world\\'s principal military powers because it recognized that many third world nations had legitimate security concerns. \"This is not a Cocom of weapons,\" one French official said, referring to the committee of 17 Western nations that has long controlled the export of sophisticated technology to Soviet-bloc and third world nations. But the French initiative nonetheless underlined the special responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council, who account for over 80 percent of all foreign weapons sales. France is believed to be the world\\'s third largest arms exporter after the United States and the Soviet Union. In its statement today, France also made it clear that it was still not willing to consider dismantling any of its three-pronged nuclear capability: missiles, submarines and aircraft. It said it supported efforts by the Soviet Union and the United States to reduce their nuclear arsenals and would be ready to join nuclear disarmament talks once conditions spelled out by Mr. Mitterrand in 1983 were met. These include the reduction of Soviet and American nuclear weapons stockpiles to the same levels as those of France. And as one Western diplomat put it, \"That\\'s still a long way from happening.\"',\n",

       "    'lead_paragraph': 'Martial-law courts are continuing trials of people accused of collaborating with Iraqi occupation forces, and in some cases witnesses for the prosecution have appeared for cross-examination. On Saturday, as a martial-law court held a one-day trial of 24 defendants, a Kuwaiti woman accused of writing for the newspaper set up by Iraq\\'s occupation force was confronted with testimony by other journalists who said they had rejected her advice to collaborate. The court then adjourned the case until June 15, when the five-man panel is to hand down verdicts and sentences on those said to have worked for the newspaper, Al Nida. Several collaboration trials have convened in the last two weeks. Today 36 defendants were on trial, mainly Palestinians. The charges ranged from theft or forgery to running a prostitution ring for Iraqi troops, Reuters reported. Two trials are set for Tuesday, including one of Iraqi actors living in Kuwait who were said to have supported the occupation, and another involving a rape charge, a Justice Ministry official said. The trial on Saturday included the first time that prosecution witnesses have spoken in public and been cross-examined by defense attorneys. A woman named Ibtessam al-Dukhail was the most important defendant at today\\'s hearing, and her case took up about half the nine hours of arguments. She has said she worked at the paper under pressure from the Iraqis. But the other journalists who testified against her undermined her case in the eyes of many neutral observers in the crowded courtroom. The trial of the newspaper employees was being closely watched by human rights advocates. They have been encouraged somewhat by the handling of the trials recently, but have said a crucial question is whether witnesses testify under cross-examination. The very first collaboration trial was a one-day affair on May 19 that heard from no prosecution witnesses and produced immediate, harsh sentences. The newspaper trial featured the same chief judge, Mohammed Jassem ibn Naji, as the first trial in the series. Apart from the three journalists who testified against Miss Dukhail, there was only one other witness for the prosecution, a police officer who testified against all 24 defendants accused of working for the newspaper. He offered mainly hearsay evidence, and repeatedly refused to reveal the sources of the information he presented. \"There are too many people whose lives are in the hands of that secret source,\" Mohammad al-Enezy, a defense lawyer, said in his closing statement. But the presiding judge refused to allow questions about the policeman\\'s informants, taking the side of the prosecution and the witness, who argued that security would be compromised if the matter was discussed in the open. All of the defendants are charged with working for Al Nida, the daily newspaper published by the occupying Iraqis after the August invasion and annexation of Kuwait. Most of them held menial or clerical jobs, and apart from Miss Dukhail, there were no other Kuwaiti citizens in the group. One defendant\\'s lawyer said his client, an Iraqi resident of Kuwait, had done the right thing by complying with the invaders\\' orders. Paraphrasing his client, the lawyer said: \"If I did not join the newspaper, I would have to join the Iraqi Army. It would be better to work for newspapers than to kill people and do bad things to Kuwaitis.\" Miss Dukhail\\'s attorney insisted that she worked for the newspaper only under threats by the Iraqi authorities. But the three other Kuwaiti journalists testified that after the invasion Miss Dukhail had personally urged them to join the paper\\'s staff.',\n",

Amer Particle Technologies Inc., based in Montecito, Calif., said its method could be an alternative to injection of protein-based drugs, like those created by the biotechnology companies. Because they are large molecules, proteins defy delivery through the nose or skin; because they are digested, they are not effective taken through the mouth.
