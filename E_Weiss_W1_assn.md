Here is a link to the GitHub dataset: https://github.com/enwweiss/DAV-5400/blob/master/sales_2018-02-01_2018-02-28_original.csv

This is Sales data from a non-profit I was the CMO of. The Data comes from Shopify, the company that manages our sales software. 

I am interested in learning from the data how I could have done my job better now that I am an Advisor for the company. 

Questions to ask: 
How can we allocate the marketing budget more efficently?
How can we optimize book ordering so that we have the most popular types of books available
What are drivers for revenue growth?
